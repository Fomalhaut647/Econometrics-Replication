| 5. Change in mean FTE employment, setting FTE at temporarily closed stores to 0<sup>d</sup> | -2.28 (1.25) | 0.33 (0.49) | 2.61 (1.77) | 0.90 (0.87) | 0.60 (0.69) | -2.16 (1.01) | 3.05 (1.42) | 2.76 (1.42) |

Notes: Standard errors are shown in parentheses. The sample consists of all stores with available data on employment.
<sup>a</sup> FTE (full-time-equivalent) employment counts each part-time worker as half a full-time worker. Employment at six closed stores is set to zero. Employment at four temporarily closed stores is treated as missing.
<sup>b</sup> Stores in New Jersey were classified by whether starting wage in wave 1 equals $4.25 per hour (N=101), is between $4.26 and $4.99 per hour (N=140), or is $5.00 per hour or higher (N=73). Difference in employment between low-wage ($4.25 per hour) and high-wage (>= $5.00 per hour) stores; and difference in employment between midrange ($4.26-$4.99 per hour) and high-wage stores.
<sup>c</sup> Subset of stores with available employment data in wave 1 and wave 2.
<sup>d</sup> In this row only, wave-2 employment at four temporarily closed stores is set to 0. Employment changes are based on the subset of stores with available employment data in wave 1 and wave 2.

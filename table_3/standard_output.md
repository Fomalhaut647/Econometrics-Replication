Notes: Standard errors are shown in parentheses. The sample consists of all stores with available data on employment. 
<sup>a</sup> FTE (full-time-equivalent) employment counts each part-time worker as half a full-time worker. Employment at six closed stores is set to zero. Employment at four temporarily closed stores is treated as missing. 
<sup>b</sup> Stores in New Jersey were classified by whether starting wage in wave 1 equals $4.25 per hour (N=101), is between $4.26 and $4.99 per hour (N=140), or is $5.00 per hour or higher (N=73). Difference in employment between low-wage ($4.25 per hour) and high-wage (>= $5.00 per hour) stores; and difference in employment between midrange ($4.26-$4.99 per hour) and high-wage stores. 
<sup>c</sup> Subset of stores with available employment data in wave 1 and wave 2. 
<sup>d</sup> In this row only, wave-2 employment at four temporarily closed stores is set to 0. Employment changes are based on the subset of stores with available employment data in wave 1 and wave 2.

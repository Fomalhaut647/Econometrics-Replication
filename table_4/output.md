**TABLE 4-REDUCED-FORM MODELS FOR CHANGE IN EMPLOYMENT**

| Independent variable                       | (i)   | (ii)  | (iii) | (iv)  | (v)   |
| :----------------------------------------- | :---------- | :---------- | :---------- | :---------- | :---------- |
| 1. New Jersey dummy                        | 2.33 (1.19) | 2.30 (1.20) |             |             |             |
| 2. Initial wage gap<sup>a</sup>            |             |             | 15.65 (6.08) | 14.92 (6.21) | 11.98 (7.42) |
| 3. Controls for chain and ownership<sup>b</sup> | no          | yes         | no          | yes         | yes         |
| 4. Controls for region<sup>c</sup>         | no          | no          | no          | no          | yes         |
| 5. Standard error of regression            | 8.79        | 8.78        | 8.76        | 8.76        | 8.75        |
| 6. Probability value for controls<sup>d</sup> |             | 0.34        |             | 0.44        | 0.40        |

Notes: Standard errors are given in parentheses. The sample consists of 357 stores with available data on employment and starting wages in waves 1 and 2. The dependent variable in all models is change in FTE employment. The mean and standard deviation of the dependent variable are -0.238 and 8.813, respectively. All models include an unrestricted constant (not reported).

<sup>a</sup> Proportional increase in starting wage necessary to raise starting wage to new minimum rate. For stores in Pennsylvania the wage gap is 0. 
<sup>b</sup> Three dummy variables for chain type and whether or not the store is company-owned are included. 
<sup>c</sup> Dummy variables for two regions of New Jersey and two regions of eastern Pennsylvania are included. 
<sup>d</sup> Probability value of joint F test for exclusion of all control variables.

Notes: Standard errors are given in parentheses. [cite: 222] Entries represent estimated coefficient of New Jersey dummy [columns (i) and (iii)] or initial wage gap [columns (ii) and (iv)] in regression models for the change in employment or the percentage change in employment. [cite: 223] All models also include chain dummies and an indicator for company-owned stores. [cite: 224]
ª Wave-2 employment at four temporarily closed stores is set to 0 (rather than missing). [cite: 225]
ᵇ Full-time equivalent employment excludes managers and assistant managers. [cite: 226]
ᶜ Full-time equivalent employment equals number of managers, assistant managers, and full-time nonmanagement workers, plus 0.4 times the number of part-time nonmanagement workers. [cite: 226]
ᵈ Full-time equivalent employment equals number of managers, assistant managers, and full-time nonmanagement workers, plus 0.6 times the number of part-time nonmanagement workers. [cite: 227]
e Sample excludes 35 stores located in towns along the New Jersey shore. [cite: 228]
f Models include three dummy variables identifying week of wave-2 interview in November-December 1992. [cite: 229]
ᵍ Sample excludes 70 stores (69 in New Jersey) that were contacted three or more times before obtaining the wave-1 interview.
ʰ Regression model is estimated by weighted least squares, using employment in wave 1 as a weight. [cite: 230]
ⁱ Subsample of 51 stores in towns around Newark. [cite: 231]
ʲ Subsample of 54 stores in town around Camden.
ᵏ Subsample of Pennsylvania stores only. Wage gap is defined as percentage increase in starting wage necessary to raise starting wage to $5.05. [cite: 232]

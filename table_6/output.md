Notes: Entries in columns (i) and (ii) represent mean changes in the outcome variable indicated by the row heading for stores with available data on the outcome in waves 1 and 2. [cite: 260] Entries in columns (iv)-(vi) represent estimated regression coefficients of indicated variable (NJ dummy or initial wage gap) in models for the change in the outcome variable. [cite: 260] Regression models include chain dummies and an indicator for company-owned stores. [cite: 261]

ªThe wage gap is the proportional increase in starting wage necessary to raise the wage to the new minimum rate. [cite: 262] For stores in Pennsylvania, the wage gap is zero. [cite: 263]

ᵇModels in column (vi) include dummies for two regions of New Jersey and two regions of eastern Pennsylvania. [cite: 263]

ᶜFraction of part-time employees in total full-time-equivalent employment. [cite: 264]

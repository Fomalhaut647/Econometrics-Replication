Notes: Standard errors are given in parentheses. Entries are estimated regression coefficients for models fit to the change in the log price of a full meal (entr√©e, medium soda, small fries). The sample contains 315 stores with valid data on prices, wages, and employment for waves 1 and 2. The mean and standard deviation of the dependent variable are 0.0173 and 0.1017, respectively.
Proportional increase in starting wage necessary to raise the wage to the new minimum-wage rate. For stores in Pennsylvania the wage gap is 0.
Three dummy variables for chain type and whether or not the store is company-owned are included.

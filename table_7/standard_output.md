Notes: Standard errors are given in parentheses. [cite: 312] Entries are estimated regression coefficients for models fit to the change in the log price of a full meal (entr√©e, medium soda, small fries). [cite: 312] The sample contains 315 stores with valid data on prices, wages, and employment for waves 1 and 2. [cite: 313] The mean and standard deviation of the dependent variable are 0.0173 and 0.1017, respectively. [cite: 313]
Proportional increase in starting wage necessary to raise the wage to the new minimum-wage rate. [cite: 314] For stores in Pennsylvania the wage gap is 0. [cite: 315]
Three dummy variables for chain type and whether or not the store is company-owned are included. [cite: 315]
Dummy variables for two regions of New Jersey and two regions of eastern Pennsylvania are included. [cite: 316]

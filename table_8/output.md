**Notes:** Standard errors are shown in parentheses. [cite: 353] The sample contains 51 state-level observations (including the District of Columbia) on the number of McDonald's restaurants open in 1986 and 1991. [cite: 354] The dependent variable in columns (i)-(iv) is the proportional increase in the number of restaurants open. [cite: 354] The mean and standard deviation are 0.246 and 0.085, respectively. [cite: 355] The dependent variable in columns (v)-(viii) is the ratio of the number of new stores opened between 1986 and 1991 to the number open in 1986. [cite: 356] The mean and standard deviation are 0.293 and 0.091, respectively. [cite: 356] All regressions are weighted by the state population in 1986. [cite: 357]

<sup>a</sup> Fraction of all workers in retail trade in the state in 1986 earning an hourly wage between $3.35 per hour and the "effective" state minimum wage in 1990 (i.e., the maximum of the federal minimum wage in 1990 ($3.80) and the state minimum wage as of April 1, 1990). [cite: 357]
<sup>b</sup> Maximum of state and federal minimum wage as of April 1, 1990, divided by the average hourly wage of workers in retail trade in the state in 1986. [cite: 358]

**TURNING POINT ANALYSIS FOR MODEL (III)**

Turning point of quadratic function: 0.1291
Benchmark comparison value [(5.05-4.25)/4.25]: 0.1882

Gap coefficient: 52.6869
Gap squared coefficient: -204.024766

Interpretation:
- The quadratic relationship peaks/troughs at a wage gap of 0.1291
- This turning point (0.1291) is LOWER than the benchmark (0.1882)
- Difference: 0.0591

Notes: Standard errors are given in parentheses. The sample consists of 357 stores with available data on employment and starting wages in waves 1 and 2. The dependent variable in all models is change in FTE employment. The mean and standard deviation of the dependent variable are -0.238 and 8.813, respectively. All models include an unrestricted constant (not reported).

<sup>a</sup> Proportional increase in starting wage necessary to raise starting wage to new minimum rate. For stores in Pennsylvania the wage gap is 0.
<sup>b</sup> Dummy variable equals 1 for New Jersey stores with starting wage of $4.25 in wave 1, 0 otherwise.
<sup>c</sup> Square of the initial wage gap variable.
<sup>d</sup> Three dummy variables for chain type and whether or not the store is company-owned are included.
<sup>e</sup> Probability value of joint F test for exclusion of chain and ownership control variables.
<sup>f</sup> Probability value for t-test of additional variable (converted from t-statistic).
